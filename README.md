[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecr/releases).


The module works in two distinct modes:

1. If you provide the existing IAM Role names in the `roles` attribute, the Roles will be granted permissions to work with the created registry.

2. If the `roles` attribute is omitted or is an empty list, a new IAM Role will be created and granted all the required permissions to work with the registry.
The Role name will be assigned to the output variable `role_name`.
In addition, an `EC2 Instance Profile` will be created from the new IAM Role, which might be assigned to EC2 instances granting them permissions to work with the ECR registry.


Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
# IAM Role to be granted ECR permissions
data "aws_iam_role" "ecr" {
  name = "ecr"
}

module "ecr" {
  source                 = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecr.git?ref=master"
  namespace              = "eg"
  stage                  = "test"
  name                   = "ecr"
  principals_full_access = [data.aws_iam_role.ecr.arn]
}
```
