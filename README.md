Terraform module to provision an [`AWS ECR Docker Container registry`](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).


> [!TIP]
> #### üëΩ Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Usage

The module creates one or more Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repositories. All repositories created
will share the same configuration. Use this module multiple times to create repositories with
different configurations.

If you provide 1 or more names in `image_names` then one repository will be created for
each of the names you provide. Those names can include "namespaces", which are just
prefixes ending with a slash (`/`).

If you do not provide any names in `image_names`, the module will create a single ECR repo
named `namespace-stage-name` or just `name` depending on the value of `use_fullname`.

Access to the repositories is granted to via the `principals_full_access` and
`principals_readonly_access` lists, which are lists of strings that can designate [any valid AWS
Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#Principal_specifying).
This module only creates the Repository Policy allowing those Principals access.
The Principals will still separately need IAM policies allowing them permission
to execute ECR actions against the repository. For more details, see
[How Amazon Elastic Container Registry Works with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html).

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
# IAM Role to be granted ECR permissions
data "aws_iam_role" "ecr" {
  name = "ecr"
}

module "ecr" {
  source = "cloudposse/ecr/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"
  namespace              = "eg"
  stage                  = "test"
  name                   = "ecr"
  principals_full_access = [data.aws_iam_role.ecr.arn]
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
