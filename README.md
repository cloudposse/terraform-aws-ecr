# terraform-aws-ecr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecr) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecr.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecr/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision an [`AWS ECR Docker Container registry`](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage

The module works in two distinct modes:

1. If you provide the existing IAM Role names in the `roles` attribute, the Roles will be granted permissions to work with the created registry.

2. If the `roles` attribute is omitted or is an empty list, a new IAM Role will be created and granted all the required permissions to work with the registry.
The Role name will be assigned to the output variable `role_name`.
In addition, an `EC2 Instance Profile` will be created from the new IAM Role, which might be assigned to EC2 instances granting them permissions to work with the ECR registry.


Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
# IAM Role is provided. It will be granted ECR permissions
data "aws_iam_role" "ecr" {
  name = "ecr"
}

module "ecr" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecr.git?ref=master"
  name                = "${var.name}"
  namespace           = "${var.namespace}"
  stage               = "${var.stage}"
  roles               = ["${data.aws_iam_role.ecr.name}"]
}
```

Example of attaching policies to a user for CI/CD

```hcl
module "cicd_user" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user.git?ref=tags/0.3.0"
  namespace = "${var.namespace}"
  stage     = "${var.stage}"
  name      = "codefresh"
}

resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "login" {
  name       = "${module.cicd_user.user_name}-login"
  users      = ["${module.cicd_user.user_name}"]
  policy_arn = "${module.kops_ecr.policy_login_arn}"
}

resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "read" {
  name       = "${module.cicd_user.user_name}-read"
  users      = ["${module.cicd_user.user_name}"]
  policy_arn = "${module.kops_ecr.policy_read_arn}"
}

resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "write" {
  name       = "${module.cicd_user.user_name}-write"
  users      = ["${module.cicd_user.user_name}"]
  policy_arn = "${module.kops_ecr.policy_write_arn}"
}
```
