# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision an [`AWS ECR Docker Container registry`](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  The module creates one or more Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repositories. All repositories created
  will share the same configuration. Use this module multiple times to create repositories with
  different configurations.

  If you provide 1 or more names in `image_names` then one repository will be created for
  each of the names you provide. Those names can include "namespaces", which are just
  prefixes ending with a slash (`/`).

  If you do not provide any names in `image_names`, the module will create a single ECR repo
  named `namespace-stage-name` or just `name` depending on the value of `use_fullname`.

  Access to the repositories is granted to via the `principals_full_access` and
  `principals_readonly_access` lists, which are lists of strings that can designate [any valid AWS
  Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#Principal_specifying).
  This module only creates the Repository Policy allowing those Principals access.
  The Principals will still separately need IAM policies allowing them permission
  to execute ECR actions against the repository. For more details, see
  [How Amazon Elastic Container Registry Works with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html).

  Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

  ```hcl
  # IAM Role to be granted ECR permissions
  data "aws_iam_role" "ecr" {
    name = "ecr"
  }

  module "ecr" {
    source = "cloudposse/ecr/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"
    namespace              = "eg"
    stage                  = "test"
    name                   = "ecr"
    principals_full_access = [data.aws_iam_role.ecr.arn]
  }
  ```
