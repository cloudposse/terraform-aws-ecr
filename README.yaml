# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision an [`AWS ECR Docker Container registry`](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  The module works in two distinct modes:

  1. If you provide the existing IAM Role names in the `roles` attribute, the Roles will be granted permissions to work with the created registry.

  2. If the `roles` attribute is omitted or is an empty list, a new IAM Role will be created and granted all the required permissions to work with the registry.
  The Role name will be assigned to the output variable `role_name`.
  In addition, an `EC2 Instance Profile` will be created from the new IAM Role, which might be assigned to EC2 instances granting them permissions to work with the ECR registry.


  Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

  ```hcl
  # IAM Role to be granted ECR permissions
  data "aws_iam_role" "ecr" {
    name = "ecr"
  }

  module "ecr" {
    source                 = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecr.git?ref=master"
    namespace              = "eg"
    stage                  = "test"
    name                   = "ecr"
    principals_full_access = [data.aws_iam_role.ecr.arn]
  }
  ```
